# AngularElectron

## Usage note
As of 2022-07-10, I have updated the libs on this so that at least they don't include security holes, but they
don't really work well together either.  Once I get a chance to work on a full stack again I'll backport what I learn
there to this repo, if it makes sense to do so.

## Tags
* Use the "angular8electron9" tag to get a basic app with angular 8 and electron 9 
* Use the "containeripc" tag to get the above with an IOC container and Inter-process communication added
* Use the "routermaterial" tag to get the above with angular routing sample and material design added
